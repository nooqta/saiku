## About

This project aims to create a robust, intelligent AI Agent capable of automating various tasks. Our agent is designed following the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework to ensure it's robust, scalable, and efficient.

### Core Architecture: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Saiku leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a cutting-edge standard for enabling AI models to interact with external tools and resources securely and efficiently. MCP is becoming increasingly vital in the AI landscape, allowing agents like Saiku to:

*   **Extend Capabilities:** Seamlessly integrate with various tools (filesystem access, web browsing, API interactions, etc.) provided by MCP servers.
*   **Access Real-time Data:** Utilize dynamic information from connected resources.
*   **Perform Complex Actions:** Go beyond text generation to execute commands, manipulate files, and interact with external systems.

By building on MCP, Saiku ensures a flexible, extensible, and future-proof architecture for AI agent development. Learn more about MCP [here](./documentation/MCP.md).

### Why Saiku?

"Saiku" (細工) in Japanese refers to detailed or delicate work, symbolizing the intricate and intelligent workings of our AI agent.

- **S**: Smart
- **A**: Artificial
- **I**: Intelligent
- **K**: Knowledgeable
- **U**: Unmatched

We chose a Japanese name to symbolize precision, innovation, and advanced technology, attributes highly respected in Japanese culture. Even though we are based in Tunisia, we believe in global collaboration and the universal appeal and understanding of technology.

### What is PEAS?

PEAS stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It's a framework used to describe the various components of an intelligent agent:

- **Performance Measure**: How well is the agent doing in its environment
- **Environment**: Where the agent operates
- **Actuators**: What actions the agent can take
- **Sensors**: How the agent perceives its environment

## Features

- Modular Design
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration
- Extensible and Customizable
- **VS Code Extension:** Interact with Saiku using voice commands directly within your editor via the [Cline Voice Assistant extension](./extensions/cline-voice-assistant/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- OpenAI API key

### Optional requirements

## 1. Using Saiku in Your Own Projects
Saiku is a versatile tool that enhances projects with advanced functionalities. This guide will help you integrate Saiku into your applications, covering the installation, configuration, and usage.

### Installation

- **Step**: Run \`npm install saiku\` in your project directory to add Saiku as a dependency.

### Usage

#### 1. Importing Saiku

- **Code**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  import Agent from 'saiku';
  \`\`\`

#### 2. Initializing Saiku Agent

- **Example**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  async function main(opts) {
    const agent = new Agent(opts); // Initialize the agent
    // Additional initialization code
  }
  \`\`\`

#### 3. Configuring Saiku

- **AgentOptions**:
  - **actionsPath** (\`string\` | \`optional\`): Path to custom action scripts.
  - **systemMessage** (\`string\` | \`optional\`): Default system message or instructions.
  - **allowCodeExecution** (\`boolean\` | \`optional\`): Flag to enable/disable code execution.
  - **interactive** (\`boolean\` | \`string\` | \`optional\`): Interactive mode setting.
  - **speech** (\`'input' | 'output' | 'both' | 'none'\`): Configures speech functionality.
  - **llm** (\`'openai' | 'vertexai' | 'ollama' | 'huggingface'\`): Specifies the language learning model. Default is \`'openai'\`.
  - **[key: string]: any** (\`optional\`): Allows additional custom properties for unique project requirements.

- **Example Configuration**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let opts = {
    actionsPath: "../actions",
    systemMessage: "Welcome to Saiku",
    allowCodeExecution: true,
    interactive: true,
    speech: "both",
    llm: "openai",
    // Custom options
  };
  \`\`\`

#### 4. Interacting with Saiku

- **Process**:
  - **Listening for User Input**: Implement input mechanisms for user interaction.
  - **Processing Queries**: The agent processes and performs actions based on queries.
  - **Generating Responses**: Generates responses or results from actions.
  - **Speaking Output**: For speech-enabled applications, configure spoken output.

- **Example Interaction**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  do {
    let userQuery = await getUserInput(); // Get user input
    agent.messages.push({ role: "user", content: userQuery });

    await agent.interact(); // Process and perform actions

    // Additional code
  } while (userQuery.toLowerCase() !== "quit");
  \`\`\`

## 2. Using the project itself
### Usage
- **Clone the Repository**:
  \`\`\`bash
  git clone https://github.com/nooqta/saiku.git
