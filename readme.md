## About

This project aims to create a robust, intelligent AI Agent capable of automating various tasks. Our agent is designed following the PEAS (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) framework to ensure it's robust, scalable, and efficient.

### Core Architecture: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Saiku leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a cutting-edge standard for enabling AI models to interact with external tools and resources securely and efficiently. MCP is becoming increasingly vital in the AI landscape, allowing agents like Saiku to:

*   **Extend Capabilities:** Seamlessly integrate with various tools (filesystem access, web browsing, API interactions, code execution, etc.) provided by connected MCP servers.
*   **Access Real-time Data:** Utilize dynamic information from connected resources (e.g., databases, APIs, system information).
*   **Perform Complex Actions:** Go beyond text generation to execute commands, manipulate files, interact with external systems, and orchestrate multi-step processes.

By building on MCP, Saiku ensures a flexible, extensible, and future-proof architecture for AI agent development. Learn more about MCP [here](./documentation/MCP.md).

### Why Saiku?

"Saiku" (細工) in Japanese refers to detailed or delicate work, symbolizing the intricate and intelligent workings of our AI agent.

- **S**: Smart
- **A**: Artificial
- **I**: Intelligent
- **K**: Knowledgeable
- **U**: Unmatched

We chose a Japanese name to symbolize precision, innovation, and advanced technology, attributes highly respected in Japanese culture. Even though we are based in Tunisia, we believe in global collaboration and the universal appeal and understanding of technology.

### What is PEAS?

PEAS stands for Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, and Sensors. It's a framework used to describe the various components of an intelligent agent:

- **Performance Measure**: How well is the agent doing in its environment? (e.g., task completion rate, efficiency)
- **Environment**: Where the agent operates (e.g., user's local machine, specific software, web)
- **Actuators**: What actions the agent can take via MCP tools (e.g., writing files, executing commands, calling APIs)
- **Sensors**: How the agent perceives its environment via MCP resources and tool outputs (e.g., reading files, getting system status, receiving API responses)

## Features

- **MCP-Powered:** Core architecture based on the Model Context Protocol for secure and extensible tool/resource integration.
- **Multi-LLM Support:** Integrates with various Large Language Models (OpenAI, Vertex AI, Ollama, Hugging Face, Mistral, Anthropic).
- **Workflow Engine:** Define and run complex, multi-step automations using JSON-based workflows.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new capabilities by connecting new MCP servers.
- **VS Code Extension:** Interact with Saiku using voice commands directly within your editor via the [Cline Voice Assistant extension](./extensions/cline-voice-assistant/).
- **Web Interface:** Chat with Saiku through a browser interface.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher recommended.
- **LLM API Key:** An API key for at least one supported Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI).

### Optional Requirements

- **MCP Servers:** For extended capabilities (like file system access, web browsing, code execution, specific API interactions, text-to-speech, speech-to-text), you need to run the corresponding MCP servers. Many servers require their own API keys or setup (e.g., ElevenLabs API key for TTS/STT, Google Cloud credentials for Vision/Calendar). Configure these in your MCP settings.
- **Git:** Required for using git-related MCP tools.

## 1. Using Saiku in Your Own Projects
Saiku can be integrated into your applications to leverage its agent capabilities.

### Installation

- **Step**: Run ```npm install saiku``` in your project directory.

### Usage

#### 1. Importing Saiku

- **Code**:
  ```javascript
  import Agent from 'saiku';
  // Or specific components if needed
  ```

#### 2. Initializing Saiku Agent

- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  async function main(opts) {
    // Ensure MCP client/server setup is handled appropriately
    const agent = new Agent(opts); // Initialize the agent
    // ...
  }
  ```

#### 3. Configuring Saiku

- **AgentOptions**:
  - **systemMessage** (`string` | `optional`): Default system message or instructions for the LLM.
  - **allowCodeExecution** (`boolean` | `optional`): Flag to enable/disable code execution (typically handled by a dedicated MCP server now).
  - **interactive** (`boolean` | `string` | `optional`): Interactive mode setting for CLI usage.
  - **llm** (`'openai' | 'vertexai' | 'ollama' | 'huggingface' | 'mistral' | 'anthropic'`): Specifies the language learning model. Default is `'openai'`.
  - **[key: string]: any** (`optional`): Allows additional custom properties.

- **Example Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  let opts = {
    systemMessage: "You are Saiku, an AI assistant.",
    interactive: true,
    llm: "openai",
    // Custom options
  };
  ```

#### 4. Interacting with Saiku

- **Process**:
  - **User Input**: Provide user queries or tasks.
  - **MCP Interaction**: The agent interacts with connected MCP servers to use tools and access resources based on the query.
  - **Response Generation**: Generates responses based on LLM processing and tool results.

- **Example Interaction**:
  ```javascript
  // Assuming 'agent' is an initialized Agent instance
  async function runInteraction(agent, userQuery) {
    agent.messages.push({ role: "user", content: userQuery });
    await agent.interact(); // Agent processes query, potentially using MCP tools
    // Handle agent's response (last message in agent.messages)
  }
  ```

## 2. Using the project itself
### Usage
- **Clone the Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nooqta/saiku.git
  ```

- **Navigate to Project Folder**:
  ```bash
  cd saiku
  ```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Configure necessary environment variables for the core agent and any MCP servers you intend to use. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file. Minimally, you need an LLM API key:
```dotenv
# OpenAI (Example)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo # Or another model

# Add other API keys as needed for specific MCP servers
# e.g., ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... for the ElevenLabs MCP server
# e.g., GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/your/keyfile.json for Google Cloud servers
```
Refer to the documentation of individual MCP servers for their specific environment variable requirements.
